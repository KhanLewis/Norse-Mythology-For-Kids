                <h2>What is Norse Mythology?</h2>
                <p> <em>"Norse"</em> is a term for the medieval Norwegian or Scandinavian civilisation.
                    <em>“Mythology”</em>
                    is a collection of myths partially related to religious or cultural tradition.
                    So… Norse mythology is medieval Norwegian myths!
                    The time of the Norse, also known as the Viking age! Was said to be around (c. 790- c. 1100 CE). The
                    Vikings believed that bravery in battle was a way to reach Valhalla.
                    They believed if they died in battle winged female spirits called Valkyries would fly down and guide
                    their souls to back to Odin to where he lived, Valhalla!

                <p><em>The King of all the Gods</em> as well as the <em>God of Battle. </em>
                    Odin's name means furious one in the Old Norse language. 
                    The Vikings used to think that he caused battles on Earth by hurling his powerful spear which was called Gungnir. 
                    He would through it to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midgard" target="_blank"> <em>Midgard</em></a> (which is Earth in Norse myths) to cause these battles! Odin also rode an eight-legged horse called Sleipnir.
                     Odin had two ravens called Hugin and Munin. 
                    These ravens would fly around Midgard, collectiing information for the Kind of all gods!</p>
