                <h2>What is Norse Mythology?</h2>
                <p> <em>"Norse"</em> is a term for the medieval Norwegian or Scandinavian civilisation.
                    <em>“Mythology”</em>
                    is a collection of myths partially related to religious or cultural tradition.
                    So… Norse mythology is medieval Norwegian myths!
                    The time of the Norse, also known as the Viking age! Was said to be around (c. 790- c. 1100 CE). The
                    Vikings believed that bravery in battle was a way to reach Valhalla.
                    They believed if they died in battle winged female spirits called Valkyries would fly down and guide
                    their souls to back to Odin to where he lived, Valhalla!
