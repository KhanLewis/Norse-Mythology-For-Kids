                <h2>What is Norse Mythology?</h2>
                <p>
                    <em>"Norse"</em> is a term for the medieval Norwegian or Scandinavian civilisation.
                    <em>“Mythology”</em>
                    is a collection of <em>myths</em>
                    partically related to religious or cultural tradition. So… Norse mythology is medieval Norwegian
                    myths! The time of the Norse, also known as the Viking age! Was said to be around (c. 790- c. 1100
                    CE). The Vikings
                    believed that bravery in battle was a way to reach Valhalla. They believed if they died in battle
                    winged female spirits called Valkyries would fly down and guide their souls to back to Odin to where
                    he lived,
                    Valhalla!

                    <em>The King of all the Gods</em> as well as the <em>God of Battle. </em> Odin's name means furious
                    one in the Old Norse language. The Vikings used to think that he caused battles on Earth by hurling
                    his powerful
                    spear which was called Gungnir. He would through it to <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midgard" target="_blank"> <em>Midgard</em></a> (which is
                    Earth in Norse myths) to cause these battles! Odin also rode an
                    eight-legged horse called Sleipnir. Odin had two ravens called Hugin and Munin. These ravens would
                    fly around Midgard, collectiing information for the Kind of all gods!

                    Freya was the goddess of love and beauty. She wept golden tears when sad. Wearing a cloak made from
                    falcon feathers, her chariot was pulled through the sky by two cats. But she would also ride her
                    faithful boar,
                    Hildisvíni.

                    Odin’s burly son Thor was the god of physical strength and thunder – he was the common people’s
                    favourite! Thor made lightning by throwing his magic hammer, called Mjollnir. Viking men wore a
                    charm of Thor’s hammer
                    around their necks for good luck. They believed that claps of thunder were the sound of his
                    chariot’s wheels! His chariot was pulled by giant goats!
